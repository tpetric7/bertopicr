\title{Visualize Topic Distribution for a Specific Document using BERTopic}
\usage{
visualize_distribution(
  model,
  text_id = 1,
  probabilities,
  filename = "topic_dist_interactive",
  auto_open = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A BERTopic model object. The model must have the method \code{visualize_distribution}.}

\item{text_id}{An integer specifying the index of the document for which the topic distribution is visualized. Default is 1.
Must be a positive integer and a valid index within the \code{probabilities} matrix.}

\item{probabilities}{A matrix or data frame of topic probabilities, with rows corresponding to documents and columns to topics.
Each element represents the probability of a topic for a given document.}

\item{filename}{A character string specifying the name of the HTML file to save the visualization. Default is "topic_dist_interactive".
The .html extension will be added automatically.}

\item{auto_open}{Logical. If TRUE, the HTML file will automatically open in the browser. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
The function does not return a value but saves an HTML file containing the visualization
and displays it in the current R environment.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the topic distribution for a specific document from a BERTopic model using Python's Plotly library.
The visualization is saved as an interactive HTML file, which can be opened and viewed in a web browser.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'topic_model' is a BERTopic model object and 'probs' is a matrix of topic probabilities
visualize_distribution(
  model = topic_model,
  text_id = 1,
  probabilities = probs,
  filename = "custom_filename",
  auto_open = TRUE)
}
}
